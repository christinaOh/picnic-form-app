# Next Steps/Areas of Improvement
1. Restrict entries to one per person
- Currently a person can fill out the form as many times as they want. A potential improvement would be to add an email field in the form and check if entries have been made with that email before accepting the form submission.

2. Display the recipe suggested by the Picnic Wizard
- Since Spoonacular provides an endpoint to get the full recipe information, it'd be cool to display the whole recipe within the Picnic Wizard card.

3. Handle text overflowing out of the picnic blanket background image
- After a certain number of attendees, the text starts to overflow out of the image. To prevent this, the image should be made to resize dynamically.
